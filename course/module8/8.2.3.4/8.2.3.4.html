        <h1>IPv6 Network Addresses</h1>
        <h2>Types of IPv6 Addresses</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>An IPv6 link-local address enables a device to communicate with other IPv6-enabled devices on the same link and only on that link (subnet). Packets with a source or destination link-local address cannot be routed beyond the link from where the packet originated.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unlike IPv4 link-local addresses, IPv6 link-local addresses have a significant role in various aspects of the network. The global unicast address is not a requirement; however, every IPv6-enabled network interface is required to have a link-local address. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If a link-local address is not configured manually on an interface, the device will automatically create its own without communicating with a DHCP server. IPv6-enabled hosts create an IPv6 link-local address even if the device has not been assigned a global unicast IPv6 address. This allows IPv6-enabled devices to communicate with other IPv6-enabled devices on the same subnet. This includes communication with the default gateway (router). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>IPv6 link-local addresses are in the FE80::/10 range. The /10 indicates that the first 10 bits are 1111 1110 10xx xxxx. The first hextet has a range of 1111 1110 10<b>00 0000</b> (FE80) to 1111 1110 10<b>11 1111</b> (FEBF). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows an example of communication using IPv6 link-local addresses.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows the format of an IPv6 link-local address.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>IPv6 link-local addresses are also used by IPv6 routing protocols to exchange messages and as the next-hop address in the IPv6 routing table. Link-local addresses are discussed in more detail in a later course.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Typically, it is the link-local address of the router and not the global unicast address that is used as the default gateway for other devices on the link. </p>
