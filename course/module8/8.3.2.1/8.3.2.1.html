      <div id="content">
          <p>Ping is a testing utility that uses ICMP echo request and echo reply messages to test connectivity between hosts. Ping works with both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To test connectivity to another host on a network, an echo request is sent to the host address using the<span class="cmd"><b> ping </b></span>command. If the host at the specified address receives the echo request, it responds with an echo reply. As each echo reply is received, ping provides feedback on the time between when the request was sent and when the reply was received. This can be a measure of network performance. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Ping has a timeout value for the reply. If a reply is not received within the timeout, ping provides a message indicating that a response was not received. This usually indicates that there is a problem, but could also indicate that security features blocking ping messages have been enabled on the network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After all the requests are sent, the ping utility provides a summary that includes the success rate and average round-trip time to the destination.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Pinging the Local Loopback</b>
          </p>
          <p>There are some special testing and verification cases for which we can use ping. One case is for testing the internal configuration of IPv4 or IPv6 on the local host. To perform this test, we ping the local loopback address of 127.0.0.1 for IPv4 (::1 for IPv6). Testing the IPv4 loopback is shown in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A response from 127.0.0.1 for IPv4, or ::1 for IPv6, indicates that IP is properly installed on the host. This response comes from the network layer. This response is not, however, an indication that the addresses, masks, or gateways are properly configured. Nor does it indicate anything about the status of the lower layer of the network stack. This simply tests IP down through the network layer of IP. If we get an error message, it is an indication that TCP/IP is not operational on the host.</p>
