            <b>ISP Services</b>
          </p>
          <p>To get access to the services of the Internet, we have to connect our data network to the Internet using an Internet Service Provider (ISP). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>ISPs have their own set of internal data networks to manage Internet connectivity and to provide related services. Among the other services that an ISP generally provides to its customers are DNS services, email services, and a website. Depending on the level of service required and available, customers use different tiers of an ISP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>ISP Tiers</b>
          </p>
          <p>ISPs are designated by a hierarchy based on their level of connectivity to the Internet backbone. Each lower tier obtains connectivity to the backbone via a connection to a higher tier ISP, as shown in the figures. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Tier 1</b>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 1, at the top of the ISP hierarchy are Tier 1 ISPs. These ISPs are large national or international ISPs that are directly connected to the Internet backbone. The customers of Tier 1 ISPs are either lower-tiered ISPs or large companies and organizations. Because they are at the top of Internet connectivity, they engineer highly reliable connections and services. Among the technologies used to support this reliability are multiple connections to the Internet backbone.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The primary advantages for customers of Tier 1 ISPs are reliability and speed. Because these customers are only one connection away from the Internet, there are fewer opportunities for failures or traffic bottlenecks. The drawback for Tier 1 ISP customers is its high cost. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Tier 2</b>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 2, Tier 2 ISPs acquire their Internet service from Tier 1 ISPs. Tier 2 ISPs generally focus on business customers. Tier 2 ISPs usually offer more services than the other two tiers of ISPs. These Tier 2 ISPs tend to have the IT resources to operate their own services such as DNS, email servers, and web servers. Other services that Tier 2 ISPs may offer include website development and maintenance, e-commerce/e-business, and VoIP. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The primary disadvantage of Tier 2 ISPs, as compared to Tier 1 ISPs, is slower Internet access. Because Tier 2 ISPs are at least one more connection away from the Internet backbone, they also tend to have lower reliability than Tier 1 ISPs. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Tier 3</b>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 3, Tier 3 ISPs purchase their Internet service from Tier 2 ISPs. The focus of these ISPs is the retail and home markets in a specific locale. Tier 3 customers typically do not need many of the services required by Tier 2 customers. Their primary need is connectivity and support. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These customers often have little or no computer or network expertise. Tier 3 ISPs often bundle Internet connectivity as a part of network and computer service contracts for their customers. While they may have reduced bandwidth and less reliability than Tier 1 and Tier 2 providers, they are often good choices for small to medium size companies.</p>
