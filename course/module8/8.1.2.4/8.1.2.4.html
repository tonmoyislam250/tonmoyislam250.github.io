          <p>To ensure that all hosts within a network are assigned a unique IP address within that network range, it is important to identify the first host address and the last host address. Hosts within a network can be assigned IP addresses within this range. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>First Host Address</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As seen in Figure 1, the host portion of the first host address will contain all 0 bits with a 1 bit for the lowest order or right-most bit. This address is always one greater than the network address. In this example the first host address on the 10.1.1.0/24 network is 10.1.1.1. It is common in many addressing schemes to use the first host address for the router or default gateway address.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Last Host Address</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The host portion of the last host address will contain all 1 bits with a 0 bit for the lowest order or right-most bit. This address is always one less than the broadcast address. As seen in Figure 2, the last host address on the 10.1.1.0/24 network is 10.1.1.254.</p>
