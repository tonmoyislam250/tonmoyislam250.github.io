      <div id="content">
          <p>The Server Message Block (SMB) is a client/server file sharing protocol, developed by IBM in the late 1980s, to describe the structure of shared network resources, such as directories, files, printers, and serial ports. It is a request-response protocol.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The SMB protocol describes file system access and how clients can make requests for files. It also describes the SMB protocol interprocess communication. All SMB messages share a common format. This format uses a fixed-sized header, followed by a variable-sized parameter and data component.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>SMB messages can:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Start, authenticate, and terminate sessions</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Control file and printer access</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Allow an application to send or receive messages to or from another device </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>SMB file-sharing and print services have become the mainstay of Microsoft networking. With the introduction of the Windows 2000 software series, Microsoft changed the underlying structure for using SMB. In previous versions of Microsoft products, the SMB services used a non-TCP/IP protocol to implement name resolution. Beginning with Windows2000, all subsequent Microsoft products use DNS naming, which allows TCP/IP protocols to directly support SMB resource sharing, as shown in Figure 1. The SMB file exchange process between Windows PCs is shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unlike the file sharing supported by File Transfer Protocol (FTP), clients establish a long-term connection to servers. After the connection is established, the user of the client can access the resources on the server as if the resource is local to the client host. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The LINUX and UNIX operating systems also provide a method of sharing resources with Microsoft networks using a version of SMB called SAMBA. The Apple Macintosh operating systems also support resource sharing using the SMB protocol.</p>
