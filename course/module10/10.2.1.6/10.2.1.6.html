          <p>Post Office Protocol (POP) enables a workstation to retrieve mail from a mail server. With POP, mail is downloaded from the server to the client and then deleted on the server.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The server starts the POP service by passively listening on TCP port 110 for client connection requests. When a client wants to make use of the service, it sends a request to establish a TCP connection with the server. When the connection is established, the POP server sends a greeting. The client and POP server then exchange commands and responses until the connection is closed or aborted. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because email messages are downloaded to the client and removed from the server, there is not a centralized location where email messages are kept. Because POP does not store messages, it is undesirable for a small business that needs a centralized backup solution. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>POP3 is desirable for an ISP, because it alleviates their responsibility for managing large amounts of storage for their email servers</p>
