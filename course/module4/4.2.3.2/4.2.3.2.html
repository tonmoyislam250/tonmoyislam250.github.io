          <p>Although an optical fiber is very thin, it is composed of two kinds of glass and a protective outer shield. Specifically, these are the: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Core</b>: Consists of pure glass and is the part of the fiber where light is carried. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cladding</b>: The glass that surrounds the core and acts as a mirror. The light pulses propagate down the core while the cladding reflects the light pulses. This keeps the light pulses contained in the fiber core in a phenomenon known as total internal reflection. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Jacket</b>: Typically a PVC jacket that protects the core and cladding. It may also include strengthening materials and a buffer (coating) whose purpose is to protect the glass from scratches and moisture. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Although susceptible to sharp bends, the properties of the core and cladding have been altered at the molecular level to make it very strong. Optical fiber is proof tested through a rigorous manufacturing process for strength at a minimum of 100,000 pounds per square inch. Optical fiber is durable enough to withstand handling during installation and deployment in harsh environmental conditions in networks all around the world.</p>
