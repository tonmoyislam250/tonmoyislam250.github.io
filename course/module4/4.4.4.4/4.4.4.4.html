      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>Data link layer protocols add a trailer to the end of each frame. The trailer is used to determine if the frame arrived without error. This process is called error detection and is accomplished by placing a logical or mathematical summary of the bits that comprise the frame in the trailer. Error detection is added at the data link layer because the signals on the media could be subject to interference, distortion, or loss that would substantially change the bit values that those signals represent.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A transmitting node creates a logical summary of the contents of the frame. This is known as the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value. This value is placed in the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field of the frame to represent the contents of the frame. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click the FCS and Stop Frame fields in the figure for more information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When the frame arrives at the destination node, the receiving node calculates its own logical summary, or CRC, of the frame. The receiving node compares the two CRC values. If the two values are the same, the frame is considered to have arrived as transmitted. If the CRC value in the FCS differs from the CRC calculated at the receiving node, the frame is discarded.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Therefore, the FCS field is used to determine if errors occurred in the transmission and reception of the frame. The error detection mechanism provided by the use of the FCS field discovers most errors caused on the media.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There is always the small possibility that a frame with a good CRC result is actually corrupt. Errors in bits may cancel each other out when the CRC is calculated. Upper layer protocols would then be required to detect and correct this data loss. </p>
