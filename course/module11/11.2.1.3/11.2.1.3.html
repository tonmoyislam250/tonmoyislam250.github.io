      <div id="content">
          <p>Three network security factors are vulnerability, threat, and attack. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Vulnerability is the degree of weakness which is inherent in every network and device. This includes routers, switches, desktops, servers, and even security devices. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Threats include the people interested and qualified in taking advantage of each security weakness. Such individuals can be expected to continually search for new exploits and weaknesses. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Threats are realized by a variety of tools, scripts, and programs to launch attacks against networks and network devices. Typically, the network devices under attack are the endpoints, such as servers and desktop computers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are three primary vulnerabilities or weaknesses: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Technological, as shown in Figure 1</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Configuration, as shown in Figure 2</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Security policy, as shown in Figure 3</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>All three of these vulnerabilities or weaknesses can lead to various attacks, including malicious code attacks and network attacks.</p>
