          <p>Another important part of network design is reliability.  Small businesses often rely on their network heavily for business operations. A failure of the network can be costly. In order to maintain a high degree of reliability, redundancy is required in the network design. Redundancy helps to eliminate single points of failure. There are many ways to accomplish redundancy in a network. Redundancy can be accomplished by installing duplicate equipment for backup purposes, but it can also be accomplished by supplying duplicate network links for critical areas, as shown in the figure. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The smaller the network, the less the chances are that redundancy of equipment is affordable. Therefore, a common way to introduce redundancy is through the use of redundant switch connections between multiple switches on the network and between switches and routers. </p>
          <p>Also, servers often have multiple NIC ports that enable redundant connections to one or more switches. In a small network, servers typically are deployed as web servers, file servers, or email servers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Small networks typically provide a single exit point toward the Internet via one or more default gateways. It is possible to provide redundancy with for obtaining routing services by implementing more than one inside Ethernet interface on the router. That way, if one interface fails, traffic may be redirected toward the other interface. However, if the router itself fails, or if the routerâ€™s connection to the ISP fails, the entire network loses connectivity to the Internet. For this reason, it may be advisable for a small business to have a second router, connected to a least-cost option account with a second service provider for backup.</p>
