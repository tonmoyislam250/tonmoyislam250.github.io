      <div id="content">
          <p>Part of network security is securing actual devices, including end devices and intermediate devices. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a new operating system is installed on a device, the security settings are factory set to their default values. In most cases, this default level of security is inadequate. There are some simple steps that should be taken that can apply to most operating systems:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Default usernames and passwords should be changed immediately. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Access to system resources should be restricted to only the individuals that are authorized to use those resources. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any unnecessary services and applications should be turned off, and uninstalled when possible.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>All devices should be updated with security patches as they become available. Often, devices shipped from the manufacture have been sitting in a warehouse for a period of time and do not have the most up-to-date patches installed. It is important, prior to implementation, to update any software and install all security patches. </p>
