      <div id="content">
          <p>To really understand the differences between TCP and UDP, it is important to understand how each implements their specific reliability functions and how they track communications. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, described in RFC 793. In addition to supporting the basic functions of data segmentation and reassembly, TCP also provides:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Connection-oriented conversations</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reliable delivery</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ordered data reconstruction</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Flow control</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Establishing a Session</b>
          </p>
          <p>The transport layer protocol TCP can provide connection-oriented conversations by creating a session between the source and destination hosts. These connections prepare the devices to communicate with each other before any data is transmitted. Within these sessions, the data for a communication between the two applications can be closely managed. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Reliable Delivery</b>
          </p>
          <p>TCP can implement a method to ensure reliable delivery of the data. In networking terms, reliability means ensuring that each piece of data that the source sends arrives at the destination. For many reasons, it is possible for a piece of data to become corrupted, or lost completely, as it is transmitted over the network. TCP can ensure that all pieces reach their destination by having the source device retransmit lost or corrupted data. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Same-Order Delivery</b>
          </p>
          <p>Because networks may provide multiple routes that can have different transmission rates, data can arrive in the wrong order. By numbering and sequencing the segments, TCP can ensure that these segments are reassembled into the proper order. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Flow Control</b>
          </p>
          <p>Network hosts have limited resources, such as memory or bandwidth. When TCP is aware that these resources are overtaxed, it can request that the sending application reduce the rate of data flow. This is done by TCP regulating the amount of data the source transmits. Flow control can prevent the loss of segments on the network and avoid the need for retransmission.</p>
