        <h1>Transport Layer Protocols</h1>
        <h2>Introducing TCP and UDP</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>In the header of each segment or datagram, there is a source and destination port. The source port number is the number for this communication associated with the originating application on the local host. As shown in the figure, the destination port number is the number for this communication associated with the destination application on the remote host.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a message is delivered using either TCP or UDP, the protocols and services requested are identified by a port number. A port is a numeric identifier within each segment that is used to keep track of specific conversations and destination services requested. Every message that a host sends contains both a source and destination port.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Destination Port</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The client places a destination port number in the segment to tell the destination server what service is being requested. For example, port 80 refers to HTTP or web service. When a client specifies port 80 in the destination port, the server that receives the message knows that web services are being requested. A server can offer more than one service simultaneously. For example, a server can offer web services on port 80 at the same time that it offers FTP connection establishment on port 21. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Source Port</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The source port number is randomly generated by the sending device to identify a conversation between two devices. This allows multiple conversations to occur simultaneously. In other words, a device can send multiple HTTP service requests to a web server at the same time. The separate conversations are tracked based on the source ports.</p>
