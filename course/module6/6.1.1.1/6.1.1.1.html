      <div id="content">
          <p>The network layer, or OSI Layer 3, provides services to allow end devices to exchange data across the network. To accomplish this end-to-end transport, the network layer uses four basic processes:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Addressing end devices</b> - In the same way that a phone has a unique telephone number, end devices must be configured with a unique IP address for identification on the network. An end device with a configured IP address is referred to as a host.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Encapsulation - </b>The network layer receives a protocol data unit (PDU) from the transport layer. In a process called encapsulation, the network layer adds IP header information, such as the IP address of the source (sending) and destination (receiving) hosts. After header information is added to the PDU, the PDU is called a packet. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Routing - </b>The network layer provides services to direct packets to a destination host on another network. To travel to other networks, the packet must be processed by a router. The role of the router is to select paths for and direct packets toward the destination host in a process known as routing. A packet may cross many intermediary devices before reaching the destination host. Each route the packet takes to reach the destination host is called a hop. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>De-encapsulation - </b>When the packet arrives at the network layer of the destination host, the host checks the IP header of the packet. If the destination IP address within the header matches its own IP address, the IP header is removed from the packet. This process of removing headers from lower layers is known as de-encapsulation. After the packet is de-encapsulated by the network layer, the resulting Layer 4 PDU is passed up to the appropriate service at the transport layer.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unlike the transport layer (OSI Layer 4), which manages the data transport between the processes running on each host, network layer protocols specify the packet structure and processing used to carry the data from one host to another host. Operating without regard to the data carried in each packet allows the network layer to carry packets for multiple types of communications between multiple hosts.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The animation in the figure demonstrates the exchange of data.</p>
