      <div id="content">
          <p>There are two primary addresses assigned to a host device: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Physical address (the MAC address)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Logical address (the IP address)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Both the MAC address and IP address work together to identify a device on the network. The process of using the MAC address and the IP address to find a computer is similar to the process of using a name and address of an individual to send a letter. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A person's name usually does not change. A person's address on the other hand, relates to where they live and can change. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Similar to the name of a person, the MAC address on a host does not change; it is physically assigned to the host NIC and is known as the physical address. The physical address remains the same regardless of where the host is placed. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The IP address is similar to the address of a person. This address is based on where the host is actually located. Using this address, it is possible for a frame to determine the location of where a frame should be sent.  The IP address, or network address, is known as a logical address because it is assigned logically. It is assigned to each host by a network administrator based on the local network that the host is connected to.  The figure demonstrates the hierarchical nature of locating an individual based on a “logical” address. Click each grouping to view how the address filters down.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Both the physical MAC and logical IP addresses are required for a computer to communicate on a hierarchical network, just like both the name and address of a person are required to send a letter.  </p>
