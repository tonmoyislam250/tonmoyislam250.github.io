        <h1>Network Protocols and Standards</h1>
        <h2>Protocols</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>At the human level, some communication rules are formal and others are simply understood based on custom and practice. For devices to successfully communicate, a network protocol suite must describe precise requirements and interactions. Networking protocols define a common format and set of rules for exchanging messages between devices. Some common networking protocols are IP, HTTP, and DHCP. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figures illustrate networking protocols that describe the following processes:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>How the message is formatted or structured, as shown in Figure 1</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The process by which networking devices share information about pathways with other networks, as shown in Figure 2</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>How and when error and system messages are passed between devices, as shown in Figure 3</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The setup and termination of data transfer sessions, as shown in Figure 4</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, IP defines how a packet of data is delivered within a network or to a remote network. The information in the IPv4 protocol is transmitted in a specific format so that the receiver can interpret it correctly. This is not much different than the protocol used to address an envelope when mailing a letter. The information must adhere to a certain format or the letter cannot be delivered to the destination by the post office.</p>
