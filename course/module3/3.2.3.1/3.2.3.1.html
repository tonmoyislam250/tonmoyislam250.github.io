        <h2>Standards Organizations</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content">
          <p>Open standards encourage competition and innovation. They also guarantee that no single company’s product can monopolize the market, or have an unfair advantage over its competition. A good example of this is when purchasing a wireless router for the home. There are many different choices available from a variety of vendors, all of which incorporate standard protocols such as IPv4, DHCP, 802.3 (Ethernet), and 802.11 (Wireless LAN). These open standards also allow a client running Apple’s OS X operating system to download a web page from a web server running the Linux operating system. This is because both operating systems implement the open standard protocols, such as those in the TCP/IP suite.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Standards organizations are important in maintaining an open Internet with freely accessible specifications and protocols that can be implemented by any vendor. A standards organization may draft a set of rules entirely on its own or in other cases may select a proprietary protocol as the basis for the standard. If a proprietary protocol is used, it usually involves the vendor who created the protocol. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Standards organizations are usually vendor-neutral, non-profit organizations established to develop and promote the concept of open standards.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Standards organizations include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Internet Society (ISOC) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Each of these organizations will be discussed in more detail in the next couple of pages.</p>
