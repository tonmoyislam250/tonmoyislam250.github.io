          <p></p>
          <p>The Internet consists of millions of hosts, each of which is identified by its unique Network layer address. To expect each host to know the address of every other host would impose a processing burden on these network devices that would severely degrade their performance.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Dividing large networks so that hosts who need to communicate are grouped together reduces the unnecessary overhead of all hosts needing to know all addresses. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For all other destinations, the hosts only need to know the address of an intermediary device, to which they send packets for all other destinations addresses. This intermediary device is called a gateway. The gateway is a router on a network that serves as an exit from that network.</p>
