            <b>Improving Security</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The IP-based network that has become the Internet originally had a small number of trusted users in U.S. government agencies and the research organizations that they sponsored. In this small community, security was not a significant issue. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The situation has changed as individuals, businesses, and organizations have developed their own IP networks that link to the Internet. The devices, services, communications, and data are the property of those network owners. Network devices from other companies and organizations do not need to connect to their network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Dividing networks based on ownership means that access to and from resources outside each network can be prohibited, allowed, or monitored.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Roll over the Access Granted and Access Denied buttons on the figure to see different levels of security.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Internetwork access within a company or organization can be similarly secured. For example, a college network can be divided into administrative, research, and student subnetworks. Dividing a network based on user access is a means to secure communications and data from unauthorized access by users both within the organization and outside it.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Security between networks is implemented in an intermediary device (a router or firewall appliance) at the perimeter of the network. The firewall function performed by this device permits only known, trusted data to access the network.</p>
