          <p>As the use of these integrated, expanding networks increase, so does the need for training for individuals who implement and manage network solutions. This training must begin with the routing and switching foundation. Achieving Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification is the first step in helping an individual prepare for a career in networking. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>CCNA certification validates an individualâ€™s ability to install, configure, operate, and troubleshoot medium-size route and switched networks, including implementation and verification of connections to remote sites in a WAN. CCNA curriculum also includes basic mitigation of security threats, introduction to wireless networking concepts and terminology, and performance-based skills. This CCNA curriculum includes the use of various protocols, such as: IP, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Serial Line Interface Protocol, Frame Relay, VLANs, Ethernet, access control lists (ACLs) and others.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This course helps set the stage for networking concepts and basic routing and switching configurations and is a start on your path for CCNA certification.</p>
