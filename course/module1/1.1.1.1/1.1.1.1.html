          <p>Among all of the essentials for human existence, the need to interact with others ranks just below our need to sustain life. Communication is almost as important to us as our reliance on air, water, food, and shelter. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The methods that we use to communicate are constantly changing and evolving. Whereas we were once limited to face-to-face interactions, breakthroughs in technology have significantly extended the reach of our communications. From cave paintings to the printing press to radio and television, each new development has improved and enhanced our ability to connect and communicate with others. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The creation and interconnection of robust data networks has had a profound effect on communication, and has become the new platform on which modern communications occur.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In todayâ€™s world, through the use of networks, we are connected like never before. People with ideas can communicate instantly with others to make those ideas a reality. News events and discoveries are known worldwide in seconds. Individuals can even connect and play games with friends separated by oceans and continents. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Networks connect people and promote unregulated communication. Everyone can connect, share, and make a difference. </p>
