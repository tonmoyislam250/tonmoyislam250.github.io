          <p>Connecting to the Internet is vital in smart home technology. DSL and cable are common technologies used to connect homes and small businesses to the Internet. However, wireless may be another option in many areas. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) is an ISP that connects subscribers to a designated access point or hot spot using similar wireless technologies found in home wireless local area networks (WLANs). WISPs are more commonly found in rural environments where DSL or cable services are not available. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Although a separate transmission tower may be installed for the antenna, it is common that the antenna is attached to an existing elevated structure such as a water tower or a radio tower. A small dish or antenna is installed on the subscriber’s roof in range of the WISP transmitter. The subscriber’s access unit is connected to the wired network inside the home. From the perspective of the home user the setup isn’t much different than DSL or cable service. The main difference is the connection from the home to the ISP is wireless instead of a physical cable.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Wireless Broadband Service</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Another wireless solution for the home and small businesses is wireless broadband. This uses the same cellular technology used to access the Internet with a smart phone or tablet. An antenna is installed outside the house providing either wireless or wired connectivity for devices in the home. In many areas, home wireless broadband is competing directly with DSL and cable services.</p>
